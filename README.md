# Mo Framework
Simple but powerful MVC PHP Framework

## What is the Mo Framework?
Mo Framework is a PHP 5.6 MVC system. It's a basic but complete implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing developers to build better and easy to maintain code with PHP.

The Mo framework comes installed with Twig; a modern template engine for PHP

## Requirements

**The framework requirements are limited.**

- PHP 5.6 or greater.
- Apache Web Server or equivalent with mod rewrite support.

> **Note:** Although a database is not required, if a database is to be used, the system is designed to work with a MySQL database using PDO.

## Installation

This framework was designed and is **strongly recommended** to be installed in the document root directory.

Installing in a sub-directory, will require changing DocumentRoot configuration in Apache Web Server

> **Note:** To use the Mo Framework, you must have an understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Mo Framework was written from scratch so you don't have to. Download, Install, Enjoy.
